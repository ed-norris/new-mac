# new-mac
For Sonoma, accurate as of Jan 2024

These are personal notes on setting up a new mac and new dev environment, but feel free to use them or comment.  I think I'm missing a few settings around the keyboard and trackpad, and of course these are my own preferences. 

## Instructions
Run through `setup.md` and `dev.md`
